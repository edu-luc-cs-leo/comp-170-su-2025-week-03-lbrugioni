The first problem focuses on taking a name and returning a greeting. Comparing the posted solutions with my own, I was able to define the fucntion as greet and used the parameter,"name" in order for the input of names to return the greeting. Futhermore, utilizing the f-string actually allowed me to run the code where "name" will be replaced with the name that I assign. Another sceniro where an f-string can be used is for graduating students. Utiziling the f-string you can create a generic message congratulating  the students and input where you want the students name,major,and awards to be within the message.After, you can request for the code to print based on the specific name and it will input the information into those specifc parameters.
Furthermore, the for loop was used within the code to greet a list of friends. This allowed me to print a list of friends that would result in each friend being individully greeted instead of typing the message over and over again. The for-statement iterates over a list by invidually going down the list and inputing them into the parameters. For example, if you create a list of graduating students you can create a for loop in order to not individually print one name with a f-string but assign the graduating students
